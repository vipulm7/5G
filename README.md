## About
#### 5G monitors your network type offline and notifies when network switches to non-5G network.

## Why?
We use 5G to surf good internet speeds but network type automatically switches to non-5G network type due to various reasons such as to save battery or weak 5G signal.
That's where 5G comes in - it notifies you when network switches to non-5G network.
